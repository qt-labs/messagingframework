/*!
    \class QMailContentManager

    \brief The QMailContentManager class defines the interface to objects that provide a storage facility for message content.
    \ingroup messaginglibrary

    Qt Extended uses the QMailContentManager interface to delegate the filtering, storage, retrieval and indexing of message content
    from the QMailStore class to classes loaded from plugin libraries.  A library may provide this service by exporting a
    class implementing the QMailContentManager interface, and an associated instance of QMailContentManagerPlugin.

    There are three roles a content manager can take, as defined by \l{QMailContentManager::ManagerRole}{ManagerRole}. This changes
    the order in which the plugins are called.

    FilterRole: A content manager may be defined as a filtering content manager by returning FilterRole from
    \l{QMailContentManager::role()}{Role}. Filtering content managers are called before message operations take place, and before
    the message is stored on the file system. Filtering content managers may change any details, and messages will be added to the database with
    the changes. As messages are not in the database, they will not have an id -- and setting one is invalid. Filtering content managers
    are not notified when a message is deleted, so they should be careful not to leak file system space. Filtering content managers
    should only return errors in fatal errors, not to indicate they filtered a message or not.

    IndexRole: A content manager may be defined as an indexing content manager by returning IndexRole from
    \l{QMailContentManager::role()}{Role}. Indexing content managers are called after successful operations have taken place,
    and the fields updated. An indexing content manager should not modify existing messages, but only be used to do something
    external to QMF (e.g. Add/Remove the message from an external index). Indexing content manager should only return errors
    in very serious circumstances.

    StorageRole: A content manager may be defined as a storage content manager by returning StorageRole from
    \l{QMailContentManager::role()}{Role} (the default). Storage content managers are used for saving and
    loading messages from the file system. The particular storage content managed used for a message is determined by
    the \l{QMailMessageMetaData::contentScheme()}{contentScheme} function of a QMailMessage object.  The identifier of
    the message content is provided by the corresponding \l{QMailMessageMetaData::contentIdentifier()}{contentIdentifier}
    function; this property is provided for the use of the storage content manager code, and is opaque to the remainder of the
    system.

    If a storage content manager provides data to clients by creating references to file-backed memory
    mappings, then the content manager must ensure that those files remain valid.  The existing content
    within the file must not be modified, and the file must not be truncated.  If the content manager
    updates the content of a message which is already exported using memory mappings, then the updated
    content should be stored to a new content location, and the message object updated with the new
    \l{QMailMessageMetaData::contentIdentifier()}{contentIdentifier} information.

    If a stored message contains parts whose content is only partially available (as defined by
    QMailMessagePartContainer::partialContentAvailable() and QMailMessagePartContainer::contentAvailable()),
    the content manager must ensure that the partial data is returned to clients in the same transfer
    encoding that it was stored with.

*/

/*!
    \enum QMailContentManager::DurabilityRequirement

    This enum type is used to define the dequirement for durability in a content management request.

    \value EnsureDurability     The content manager should make the requested changes durable before reporting success.
    \value DeferDurability      The content manager may defer ensuring that changes are durable until the next invocation of ensureDurability().
    \value NoDurability         The content manager will not make changes durable.
*/

/*!
    \enum QMailContentManager::ManagerRole

    This enum type is used to define the purpose of the plugin

    \value FilterRole The content manager is a filtering content manager. It is used to modify messages
           that match its own criteria. Filtering content managers are called before any others.
    \value StorageRole The content manager is a storage content manager. It is used to storage messages
           persistently. Storage content managers are called after filter content managers, but
           before index content managers.
    \value IndexRole The content manager is for indexing purposes. It is called after the message has been
           stored.

*/

/*!
    \fn QMailStore::ErrorCode QMailContentManager::add(QMailMessage *message, QMailContentManager::DurabilityRequirement durability)

    Tells the content manager of a new \a message. If this is a storage content manager it should add to storage and then update the
    message such that its \l{QMailMessageMetaData::contentIdentifier()}{contentIdentifier}
    property contains the location at which the content is stored.

    Returns \l{QMailStore::NoError}{NoError} to indicate success.

    If \l{QMailMessageMetaData::contentIdentifier()}{contentIdentifier} is already populated at invocation,
    the content manager should determine whether the supplied identifier can be used.  If not, it should
    use an alternate location and update \a message with the new identifier.

    If \a durability is \l{QMailContentManager::EnsureDurability}{EnsureDurability} then the content
    manager should ensure that the message addition has been recorded in a durable fashion before reporting
    success to the caller.
*/

/*!
    \fn QMailStore::ErrorCode QMailContentManager::update(QMailMessage *message, QMailContentManager::DurabilityRequirement durability)

    Notifies the content manager that \a message has been updated. If this is a storage content manager
    it should update the message content stored at the location indicated
    by \l{QMailMessageMetaData::contentIdentifier()}{contentIdentifier}, to contain the current
    content of \a message.
    Returns \l{QMailStore::NoError}{NoError} to indicate successful update of the message content.

    If the updated content is not stored to the existing location, the content manager should
    use an alternate location and update \a message with the new
    \l{QMailMessageMetaData::contentIdentifier()}{contentIdentifier}.

    The existing content should be removed if the update causes a new content identifier to
    be allocated.  If the previous content cannot be removed, but the update was otherwise
    successful, the content manager should return \l{QMailStore::ContentNotRemoved}{ContentNotRemoved}
    to indicate that removal of the content should be retried at a later time.

    If \a durability is \l{QMailContentManager::EnsureDurability}{EnsureDurability} then the content
    manager should ensure that the message update has been recorded in a durable fashion before reporting
    success to the caller.
